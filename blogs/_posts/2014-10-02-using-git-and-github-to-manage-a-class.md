*Calen tells us about the advantages of using Git and GitHub for his classes at O&B University.*

I’m having all my trainees submit their work through Git & GitHub. I see the following advantages:

- I can have them do group work but I can still keep track of individual contributions.
- I can see their thought process, not just the final product.
- In case trainees would like to review their learnings at a future date, they can conveniently find their code.
- And of course, they learn good software engineering practice.

If you review a commit on Github, it shows you just the code that changed, and the difference from the old code to the new code. I find this really convenient for learning about may trainee’s thought processes, and finding teachable moments where I can provide advice.
