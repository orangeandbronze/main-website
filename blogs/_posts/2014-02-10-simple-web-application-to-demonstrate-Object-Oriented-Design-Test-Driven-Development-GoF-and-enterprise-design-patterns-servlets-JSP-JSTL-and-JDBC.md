I’ve started building a simple web application to demonstrate Object-Oriented Design, Test-Driven Development, GoF and Enterprise Design Patterns, Servlets, JSP, JSTL and JDBC. I’ll be using this for my training courses. Comments welcome, especially if you spot errors! [You can find it here](https://github.com/calen-legaspi/School-Registration-Web-App){:target="_blank"}.
