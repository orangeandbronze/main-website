- Agile Myth #4:  "Agile Cannot Work with Fixed Budgets"
- Agile Myth #5:  "Agile is Unpredictable"
- Agile Myth #6:  "Agile Means No Upfront Design"
- Agile Myth #7:  "Agile Means No Documentation"
- Agile Myth #8:  "Agile Will Prevent Problems"
- Agile Myth #9:  "Agile Means No Managers"
- Agile Myth #10: "Agile Means Weak Control"
- Agile Myth #11: "Agile is Easy"
