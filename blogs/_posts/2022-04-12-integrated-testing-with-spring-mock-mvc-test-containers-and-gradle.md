Calen presented a webinar on Integration Testing as part of PSIA's advocacy for the upskilling of talent in the local IT and software industry.

This webinar discussed the following:

- Separating unit tests from integration tests in Gradle
- Isolating tests from each other via test containers (Java library for launching Docker instances)
- Testing for race conditions (concurrency scenarios)
