## What? A Groovy and Grails infographic?

Yes, finally! We’ve been trying to look all over the interwebz for a Grails infographic because we wanted to share its awesomeness to the world. We know that only a select few can be bothered to read lengthy articles or blogs – a lot of you just want to look at pretty pictures…admit it.

So we looked and looked – but, alas, we couldn’t find one. We have been fans of Grails from waaaaay back (we’ve been working on Grails projects even before version 1.0 was released, believe it or not) – and as a [Grails development company](https://www.orangeandbronze.com/), we decided to put this unfortunate situation into our hands and created one ourselves.

Enjoy and you’re welcome! Now go and spread this goodness around.
