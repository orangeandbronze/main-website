      <H3>Practical Lessons from Seasoned Practitioners</H3>
      <p>
        The difference with O&B training is that it is primarily a software development company, not a pure training institution. The course content is product of lessons learned from dozens of tough projects, not just theories and concepts. Trainers are seasoned practitioners with the war stories to prove it, and can give trainees practical advice on real-world scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the training, O&B consultants can continue to coach (review & advise) trainees on how they are applying lessons learned to their actual projects.
