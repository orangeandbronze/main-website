<h4>Compensation Package up to Php 150,000</h4>
<p>Our Scrum Masters are servant leaders, who facilitate high quality, high performance software engineering within dedicated value-delivery teams. They are experts in Scrum, Lean and general Agile principles.</p>
<p>Our Scrum Masters welcome change and uncertainty, using Scrum as a living framework for establishing healthy work practices and psychological safety for their team, and indeed for our customers. They champion the needs of customers and the needs of their team with equal passion.</p>
<p>Our Scrum Masters are emotionally intelligent, and prefer to use soft skills and soft power to continuously improve team collaboration and development practices, resulting in predictable (convergent) iteration velocity and high performance after a relatively small number of iterations. They work proactively to remove waste from the team process and inputs on a daily basis. They are self-motivated, self-organising and driven by a passionate desire to increase flow, in their teams, customers, and the wider O&B business.</p>
<p>Our Scrum Masters have enough experience and common sense to exercise authoritative power when immediate action is unavoidable. And they have enough self-confidence to trust their team to deliver the right value at the right time, without micromanaging.</p> 
<p>Our Scrum Masters understand the importance of good organisation, transparency, and keeping our project management tools up-to-date, especially in the context of remote work. They strive to ensure the right people have the right knowledge at the right time. They thrive when challenged, and compassionately challenge others to become the best versions of themselves.</p>
<p>Our Scrum Masters are biased towards action, preferring to ask for forgiveness rather than wait for permission. They help us to fail fast, so as to maximise learning early.</p> 
<p>Acting in O&B’s best interests is at the heart of everything they do.</p>

    <li>Work closely with our customers (aka Product Owners) to ensure business expectations and release plans are closely aligned.</li>

    <li>Facilitate Scrum ceremonies, particularly Daily Standups, Iteration Planning, Retrospectives, and Demos.</li>
    <li>Teach and coach their team(s) as required, to achieve high conscious competence in the Scrum mindset and practices, for all team members.</li>

    <li>Work diplomatically and empathetically to find positive outcomes from conflict.</li>
