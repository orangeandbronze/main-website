                      <blockquote>“I wanted to create a place where I would like to work, where we adopt best practices in the industry. I wanted to build a place that offers plenty of opportunities to learn, and is filled with bright minds that help each other grow. Back in the early days of my career, my co-programmers weren’t passionate, training was hardly ever provided, and we didn’t have mentors.<br>
                      In starting O&B, I wanted to change all that. At O&B, we put learning at the forefront of our business, and axe all the unnecessary rigid rules.” - <cite>Calen Legaspi | O&B CEO</cite></blockquote>
